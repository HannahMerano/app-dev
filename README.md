My first repository 
## Resident Evil
[ResidentEvil](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120804/)
**The Resident Evil is all about zombies.**
**It is my favorite because it's horror movie.**
**It has also many series and every series it has plot twist.**
**I really also admire Alice the main character of the movie.**
**The Resident Evil is all about:**
- A special military unit fights
- They are experimenting Alice and creating a clone
- They are also called "T-Virus"
- It's spread and now it has many zombies and Alice will fight to save the world
  
  **In some points the Resident Evil is also about saving the world and preventing from evils.**
